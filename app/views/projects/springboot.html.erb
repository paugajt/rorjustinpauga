  <p class="projects-text" style="text-align: center">Database web application built using Spring Boot, Java, HTML, and CSS. Developed using Agile development techniques with my Scrum group, RebelScrum. The application stores professors, students and administrators. It also keeps track of courses, sections, buildings and classrooms. Functionality includes creating a schedule based on a semester and year as well as assigning professors to a section of a course and allowing students to sign up for sections.</p>
