# README

This application was built using Ruby on Rails 5. It contains mostly static pages
that makes a personal portfolio website for me. 

The idea is to have a place where potential employers can learn about me and see some of the 
work that I've done while pursuing my Computer science degree. 

This application is hosted by heroku and uses my own domain name.
